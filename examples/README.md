# Examples

This directory contains examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
They can be run directly in MS VSCode by connecting to a devcontainer,
by building and running the `Dockerfile` in the `docker` directory at the
project home, or by instaling the packages in the `requirements.txt`
file and adding the `witxcraft` directory from the project home in your
`PYTHONPATH`.
